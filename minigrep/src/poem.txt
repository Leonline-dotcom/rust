Ode to the Juicy Butts

In the land of curves so grand,
Where juicy butts take a mighty stand,
Round and plump, they proudly sway,
Turning heads along the way.

From jeans to shorts, they fill the space,
With confidence, they set the pace.
No shame, no fear, they strut with pride,
Juicy butts, they cannot hide!

With every step, a gentle bounce,
A rhythmic jiggle that can't be renounced.
They dance to their own joyful beat,
A work of art, oh, so sweet.

So here's to butts, both big and bold,
In all their glory, they break the mold.
Embrace the curves, let them shine,
For every shape is simply divine!
